# Lecture 6 - Electric fields in materials

This directory contains the Lecture Notes for Lecture 6, <i>Elektriska f√§lt i
material</i> (English: <i>Electric fields in materials</i>), including all TeX
code (plain TeX, no LaTeX), MetaPost figures and supporting material as used
in my lectures on Electromagnetic Theory II (1TE626) for Engineering Physics
(master level) at Uppsala University.

## Compiling the TeX code and figures

In this directory, the included `Makefile` can be used to regenerate the
documents, figures and graphs. Just run `make` and ensure to install any
missing components in case there are any complaints.
