# Figures for Lecture No.6 in Electromagnetic Theory II (1TE626)

This repository contains all MetaPost code for the figures used in Lecture 6
of my series of lectures on Electromagnetic Theory II (1TE626) for Engineering
Physics (master level) at Uppsala University.

## Compiling the MetaPost figures

Just run `make` and ensure to install any missing components in case there
are any complaints.

## List of figures

[`dipole.mp`](dipole.mp)
    ([`dipole.mp.pdf`](dipole.mp.pdf))
    <i>MetaPost drawing of the classical single and static electric
    dipole, excited by an externally applied electric field.</i>

[`displace.mp`](displace.mp)
    ([`displace.mp.pdf`](displace.mp.pdf))
    <i>MetaPost drawing of the more detailed model of the classical single
    and static electric dipole, excited by an externally applied electric
    field.</i>

[`esurfnorm.mp`](esurfnorm.mp)
    ([`esurfnorm.mp.pdf`](esurfnorm.mp.pdf))
    <i>MetaPost drawing of the surface with charge density over which we
    apply Gauss' law in order to extract boundary conditions for the electric
    field normal to the surface.</i>

[`esurftang.mp`](esurftang.mp)
    ([`esurftang.mp.pdf`](esurftang.mp.pdf))
    <i>MetaPost drawing of the surface with charge density over which we
    apply Gauss' law in order to extract boundary conditions for the electric
    field tangential to the surface.</i>

[`poldensity.mp`](poldensity.mp)
    ([`poldensity.mp.pdf`](poldensity.mp.pdf))
    <i>MetaPost drawing of the molecular polarizability building up the
    polarization density.</i>
