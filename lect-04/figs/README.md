# Figures for Lecture No.3 in Electromagnetic Theory II (1TE626)

This repository contains all MetaPost code for the figures used in Lecture 3
of the series of lectures on Electromagnetic Theory II (1TE626) for Engineering
Physics (master level) at Uppsala University.

## Compiling the MetaPost figures

Just run `make` and ensure to install any missing components in case there
are any complaints.

## List of figures

[`ampereforce.mp`](ampereforce.mp)
    ([`ampereforce.pdf`](ampereforce.pdf))
    <i>MetaPost drawing of the force acting upon the charge transport
    (current) in a fixed trajectory, illustrating the Ampere force law
    on current loops.</i>

[`biotsavart.mp`](biotsavart.mp)
    ([`biotsavart.pdf`](biotsavart.pdf))
    <i>MetaPost drawing of the setup used in Biot--Savart's law, describing
    the generation of a magnetic field by a steady-state current.</i>

[`lorentz.mp`](lorentz.mp)
    ([`lorentz.pdf`](lorentz.pdf))
    <i>MetaPost drawing of a point charge moving with velocity <b>v</b>
    in a magnetic field <b>B</b>, illustrating the resulting Lorentz
    force <b>F</b> acting of the charge.</i>
