# Figures for Lecture No.12 in Electromagnetic Theory II (1TE626)

This repository contains all MetaPost code for the figures used in Lecture 12
of my series of lectures on Electromagnetic Theory II (1TE626) for Engineering
Physics (master level) at Uppsala University.

## Compiling the MetaPost figures

Just run `make` and ensure to install any missing components in case there
are any complaints.
