# Lecture Notes on Electromagnetic Theory II (1TE626) at Uppsala University

This repository contains all TeX code, MetaPost figures and supporting material
as used in my lectures on Electromagnetic Theory II (1TE626) for Engineering
Physics (master level) at Uppsala University.

The directory contains the following subdirectories:

    `lect-06`   Elektriska fält i material (Electric fields in materials)
    `lect-07`   Magnetiska fält i material (Magnetic fields in materials)

## Compiling the TeX code and figures

In each directory, the included `Makefile` can be used to regenerate the
documents, figures and graphs. Just run `make` and ensure to install any
missing components in case there are any complaints.
