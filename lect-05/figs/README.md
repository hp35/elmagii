# Figures for Lecture No.5 in Electromagnetic Theory II (1TE626)

This repository contains all MetaPost code for the figures used in Lecture 3
of the series of lectures on Electromagnetic Theory II (1TE626) for Engineering
Physics (master level) at Uppsala University.

## Compiling the MetaPost figures

Just run `make` and ensure to install any missing components in case there
are any complaints.

## List of figures

[`faradayelement.mp`](faradayelement.mp)
    ([`faradayelement.pdf`](faradayelement.pdf))
    <i>MetaPost drawing of the enlarged area element dA, being part of the
    "ribbon" between the closed trajectory Gamma(t) and Gamma(t+dt) in the
    formal and general derivation of Faradays law of induction (the "flux
    law"). This figure is part of the figure drawn by the MetaPost code in
    faradayrib.mp.</i>

[`faradayrect.mp`](faradayrect.mp)
    ([`faradayrect.pdf`](faradayrect.pdf))
    <i>MetaPost drawing of the setup of a closed, rectangular current-carrying
    loop dragged over a homogeneous field in such a way that the magnetic flux
    through the loop is linearly decreasing with time. This is the simplest
    illustration of the Faraday induction law, based directly on the Lorentz
    force acting upon the charges in the conducting wire, and serves as an
    illustration of the general case.</i>

[`faradayrib.mp`](faradayrib.mp)
    ([`faradayrib.pdf`](faradayrib.pdf))
    <i>MetaPost drawing of the setup of a closed current-carrying loop and
    the electro-motoric force (EMF) driving a current through this whenever
    the magnetic flow enclosed by the loop is altered, either by means of a
    magnetic field which is changing in time or by means of a change in the
    orientation or position of the loop itself. This is the basic setup in
    which we derive Faraday's law of induction.</i>

[`inductance.mp`](inductance.mp)
    ([`inductance.mp.pdf`](inductance.mp.pdf))
    <i>MetaPost drawing of the geometry used in deriving the mutual
    inductance between two conducting loops Gamma and Gamma'.</i>

[`inductioncases.mp`](inductioncases.mp)
    ([`inductioncases.pdf`](inductioncases.pdf))
    <i>MetaPost drawing of the three principal ways of inducing an
    electromotoric force (EMF) be the Faraday law of induction
    (flux law), being
    (1) a closed circuit moving through a stationary inhomogeneous
        magnetic field,
    (2) a stationary closed circuit through which an inhomogeneous
        magnetic field is moving, and
    (3) a stationary closed circuit through which a the magnetic
        flux is varying in time.</i>

[`lenz.mp`](lenz.mp)
    ([`lenz.pdf`](lenz.pdf))
    <i>MetaPost drawing of a set of eight geometries and thought-experients
    concerning the interpretation of Lenz law and how to sanity-check results
    in induction problems.</i>

[`magflow.mp`](magflow.mp)
    ([`magflow.pdf`](magflow.pdf))
    <i>MetaPost drawing of electric flow through a surface, including a
    displayed equation with the definition of electric flow.</i>
