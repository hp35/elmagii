# Lecture 11 - Retarded potentials as solutions to Maxwell's equations

This directory contains the Lecture Notes for Lecture 11, <i>Retarderade
potentialer som l√∂sningar till Maxwells ekvationer</i> (English: <i>Retarded
potentials as solutions to Maxwell's equations</i>), including all TeX code
(plain TeX, no LaTeX), MetaPost figures and supporting material.

## Compiling the TeX code and figures

In this directory, the included `Makefile` can be used to regenerate the
documents, figures and graphs. Just run `make` and ensure to install any
