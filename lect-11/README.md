# Lecture 11 - Retarded potentials as solutions to Maxwell's equations

This directory contains the Lecture Notes for Lecture 11, <i>Retarderade
potentialer som lösningar till Maxwells ekvationer</i> (English: <i>Retarded
potentials as solutions to Maxwell's equations</i>), including all TeX code
(plain TeX, no LaTeX), MetaPost figures and supporting material.

## Primary files of interest

[lecture-11.tex](lecture-11.tex) - Plain TeX source code for the lecture.

[lecture-11.pdf](lecture-11.pdf) - Compiled document containing the Lecture Notes.

## Compiling the TeX code and figures

In this directory, the included `Makefile` can be used to regenerate the
documents, figures and graphs. Just run `make` and ensure to install any
missing components in case there are any complaints.
