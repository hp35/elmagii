# Figures for Lecture No.2 in Electromagnetic Theory II (1TE626)

This repository contains all MetaPost code for the figures used in Lecture 2
of the series of lectures on Electromagnetic Theory II (1TE626) for Engineering
Physics (master level) at Uppsala University.

## Compiling the MetaPost figures

Just run `make` and ensure to install any missing components in case there
are any complaints.

## List of figures

[`linecharge.mp`](linecharge.mp)
    ([`linecharge.pdf`](linecharge.pdf))
    <i>MetaPost drawing of a line charge enclosed by a "gaussian
    surface" with the purpose of extracting the electric field.</i>

[`lineintegral.mp`](lineintegral.mp)
    ([`lineintegral.pdf`](lineintegral.pdf))
    <i>MetaPost drawing of the line integral from which we via Stokes'
    theorem can deduce that the rotation of the static electric field
    is identically zero.</i>

[`potential.mp`](potential.mp)
    ([`potential.pdf`](potential.pdf))
    <i>MetaPost drawing of the line integral from which we deduce the
    existence of the (scalar) electrostatic potential.</i>

[`surfcharge.mp`](surfcharge.mp)
    ([`surfcharge.pdf`](surfcharge.pdf))
    <i>MetaPost drawing of a surface charge enclosed by a "gaussian
    surface" with the purpose of extracting the electric field.</i>
