# Lecture 1 - Electrostatics, the superposition principle and Gauss law

This directory contains the Lecture Notes for Lecture 1, <i>Elektrostatik,
superpositionsprincipen och Gauss lag</i> (English: <i>Electrostatics, the
superposition principle and Gauss law</i>), including all TeX code (plain
TeX, no LaTeX), MetaPost figures and supporting material.

## Primary files of interest

[lecture-01.tex](lecture-01.tex) - Plain TeX source code for the lecture.

[lecture-01.pdf](lecture-01.pdf) - Compiled document containing the Lecture Notes.

## Compiling the TeX code and figures

In this directory, the included `Makefile` can be used to regenerate the
documents, figures and graphs. Just run `make` and ensure to install any
missing components in case there are any complaints.
