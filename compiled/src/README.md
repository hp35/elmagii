# Supporting TeX macros and definitions

This repository contains all supportive TeX macros and definitions, including a
preface, to be used in the generation of a compiled single-document set of the
entire set of Lecture Notes.

## Contributing

Reports on errors, inconsistencies or improvements in general are most welcome!

## Compiling the TeX code and figures

The files in the present directory are not intended for individual compilation.
Change to the parent directory `compiled` and run `make` in order to recompile
the entire set of Lecture Notes into a single document.

In order to generate all documents and figures in all individual lectures, just
run `make` in the `elmagii` root directory. In order to clean up all directories,
just run `make clean` in the `elmagii` root directory.
